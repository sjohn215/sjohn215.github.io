        <h2>How do I access my credit report for free?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> is the <em>only</em> website officially authorized by federal law to help you access your free annual credit reports.</p>
        
        <h2>Why do I have more than one credit report?</h2>
        <p>There are three companies in the United States that track your credit history. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equifax</li>
            <li>Experian</li>
            <li>TransUnion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When someone requests a copy of your credit report or credit score—an employer, a landlord, or a bank, for example—they're paying one or more of these companies to get access to your credit score and/or credit report. Each of these companies has slightly different methods for tracking your credit history and calculating your credit score, so your information may be slightly different depending on which company someone uses to access your credit information.</p>
        
        <h2>So multiple companies track whether or not I pay my bills on time? That sounds creepy.</h2>
        <p>That's because it <em>is</em> kind of creepy. Unfortunately, if you want to open a credit card or take out a loan in the United States, there's no way to prevent your credit information from being shared with credit-reporting companies. Your credit report and score are tied to your social security number, so every time you use your social security number to get approved for some sort of financial service, the service provider is checking your score to decide how risky it will be to lend you money. And if you don't pay your bills, the company you borrowed money from will tell the credit-reporting companies and your score will go down.</p> <p>Even utility companies&mdash;the companies that supply you with things like electricity and internet access&mdash;will typically check your credit before providing you with service. If you don't have good credit or don't want your credit checked, you may have to provide a deposit to the utility company before they will activate your service. This is a great example of one of the many ways that people with bad credit are forced to pay more for the same services when compared to people with good credit.</p>
        <p>While all of this might sound a little intrusive, the good news is you can request a free credit report once each year from each of the free agencies and you have the right to dispute any incorrect information on your report.</p>
        <h2>Do bad things stay on my credit report forever?</h2>
        <p>No. Just about everything on your credit report, both good and bad, is only tracked for the past seven years. One exception is Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which stays on your credit report for 10 years. This type of bankruptcy stays on your report longer because it might eliminate your debt completely. This is different from a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which  requires that your creditors receive at least part of what they're owed before your debt is erased. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy is removed from your report in seven years.</p>
        <p>How long does a home foreclosure stay on my credit report?</p>
        <p>Foreclosures, like most other types of negative credit report activity, usually fall off of your report automatically after seven years.</p>
