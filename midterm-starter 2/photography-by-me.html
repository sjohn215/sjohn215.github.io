        <p>This is a photo i took on April 23rd. My friend and I decided to try and catch the sunrise at 6 am but sadly thee was overcast :(. In light of this situation I was able to capture this really cool photo of The vandalized Lifeguard pier. This is one of my favorite photos so I hope you enjoy!.</p>
