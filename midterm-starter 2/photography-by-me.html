        <p>This is a photo i took on April 23rd. My friend and I decided to try and catch the sunrise at 6 am but sadly thee was overcast :(. In light of this situation I was able to capture this really cool photo of The vandalized Lifeguard pier. This is one of my favorite photos so I hope you enjoy!.</p>

        <p>This is a photo I took on my Iphone while at the Belmont train stop. I edited the sky in order to make it appear as if the sky was orange when in actuality it was blue. This is one of my favorite spots because i grew up in this area as a kid and always amired the different styles from residence wihin the area. </p>
